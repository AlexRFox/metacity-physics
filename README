A mod to Metacity to allow the user to "toss" windows, which bounce of
edges of screens. Currently only has been tested on single screen
setup, and doesn't work very well yet. For now, it assumes two 25px
bars, one on top of screen one on bottom.

This git repository is based on Metacity 2.28.0 (current Ubuntu 9.10
apt-get source), and will probably work on any fairly similar Metacity
versions.

Future plans include:
* Allowing windows to move between screens and/or workspaces
* Auto detection of taskbars
* Cleaning up coding to follow Metacity conventions
* Moving coding into other files for neatness
* Creating a GUI interface for all variables, plus an easy way to enable
   or disable the mod.
* Setting up an easy way to install mod
