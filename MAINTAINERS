Elijah Newren
Email: newren gmail com
Userid: newren

  - Usually won't touch the theme bugs (isn't interested) or the
    compositor (until open source nvidia drivers are up to snuff).
    Tends to be most interested in libwnck/gtk interactions, focus
    issues, constraints problems, and raising/stacking, but works on
    just about anything other than themes and the compositor.

Thomas Thurman
Email: thomas thurman org uk
Userid: tthurman

  - Responsible for all theme bugs and the compositor (thank goodness
    Thomas got involved, eh?).  I'm sure he'll replace this sentence
    with his interests when he reads it.  ;-)
